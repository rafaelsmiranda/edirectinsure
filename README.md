# EdirectInsure Code Challenge
Simple ToDo app done with React with backend made with NodeJS.

To run the application just run `docker-compose up` and visit `http://localhost:8081`

Due to time restrictions and the fact that I don't touch frontend development for three years (and never used React), I must state the following:
- the UI is not refined. Clearly lot can be done to improve it.
- unit testing was left out. I would use Jest to at least test the backend, but couldn't spare the time.

All in all, I guess it was a interesting challenge, mainly because it was a full stack challenge with so little time.
